<h3>About this page</h3>

This is Nilatac's opening book. <a href="http://catalin.francu.com/nilatac">Nilatac</a> is my suicide chess program. Leaf nodes (including leaves
marked as <span class="lost">lost</span>) are solvable (by Nilatac) using a PN search of 2,000,000 nodes or less.

This page would not have been possible without help from:

<ul> 
  <li>Ben Nye (angrim on FICS) for giving me countless worthy ideas that helped me optimize Nilatac, from endgame tables to alpha-beta to PN
  search. In particular, he helped me finish the proof for <b>1. e3 c6</b> (<a

  particular line). This has literally saved me from insanity.</li>

  <li>Lenny Taelman (lenthep on FICS) for hosting a collection of suicide openings and a 4-piece endgame browser (sadly, those are no longer
  available); also for lending me the board images.</li>

  <li><a href="http://poincare.matf.bg.ac.rs/~daad/people/Andrejic/Andrejic.htm">Vladica Andrejic</a> (AndrewTheAlmighty on FICS) for sharing his
  knowledge of openings with me and helping me solve some openings, in particular <b>1. e3 c6</b>; for beating Nilatac a great number of times, thus
  giving me material to work with in improving Nilatac; and for asking to see Nilatac's proofs so many times, that I ended up writing this script to
  make the book browsable online :-)</li>

  <li>Mark Watkins of the University of Sydney for resuscitating interest in suicide chess and for sharing his proofs for <b>1. e3 Nc6</b> and the
  remaining three lines for <b>1. e3 b5</b>.</li>

  <li>and, of course, <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~breukerd/thesis">Dennis Breuker</a> and <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Allis">Victor Allis</a> for inventing proof number search.</li>
