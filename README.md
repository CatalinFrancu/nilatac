# Nilatac
A suicide chess engine compatible with xboard and FICS

## Status

Nilatac is not under active development. I have moved the code here because GitHub is more popular than Subversion, but I haven't worked on the code for many years (except for occasional flurries of book research).

If you have questions or contributions, please contact me - I still have a general interest in suicide chess.
