<b>About this page</b>

<br/><br/>

This is Nilatac's opening book. Nilatac is my suicide chess program
and you can find more about it at <a href="/nilatac">Nilatac's
page</a>. Nodes marked as "LOST" without further descendants are
solvable (by Nilatac) using a PN search of 2,000,000 nodes or less.

<br/><br/>

There are several persons I want to thank here for helping me:

<ul>
  <li>Ben Nye (angrim on FICS) for giving me countless worthy ideas
  that helped me optimize Nilatac, from endgame tables to alpha-beta
  to PN search. In particular, he helped me finish the proof for <b>e3
  c6</b> (<a

  particular line). This has literally saved me from insanity.</li>

  <li><a href="http://lenthep.dyndns.org:8080">Lenny Taelman</a>
  (lenthep on FICS) for hosting a great collection of <a
  href="http://lenthep.dyndns.org:8080/suicide/proofs/compressed/">suicide
  openings</a>, as well as a 4-piece <a
  href="http://lenthep.dyndns.org:8080/stb/">endgame browser</a>; also
  for lending me the graphical images you're seeing.</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.matf.bg.ac.yu/~andrew/suicide/">Vladica
  Andrejic</a> (AndrewTheAlmighty on FICS) for sharing his knowledge
  of openings with me and helping me solve some openings, in
  particular e3 c6; for beating Nilatac a great number of times, thus
  giving me material to work with in improving Nilatac; and for asking
  to see Nilatac's proofs so many times, that I ended up writing this
  script to make the book browsable online :-)</li>

  <li>and, of course, <a
  href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~breukerd/thesis">Dennis Breuker</a> and
  Victor Allis for developing the proof number search algorithm.</li>
</ul>
